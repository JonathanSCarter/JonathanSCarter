### Hello!
### I am a new software developer with a passion for backend development! I enjoy working with python, and am actively looking for work.

### I have learned how to use Python, JavaScript, Flask, Express, SQLAlchemy, SQLite, React, and Redux. 

### I enjoy playing chess, doing recreational math, and hanging out with friends.

### My two projects are Nile, which is an amazon clone, that I built by myself. It allows users to put up items on the store, as well as purchase and review items. 
### My other project is Cypher, which I built with my friends at App Academy. It's a slack clone, and features websockets to allow for dynamic chatting!
